# Harry Newton's Prework Study Guide

## Description

As a bootcamp student, it is important to keep track of all the new material I have learned throughout prework.

I created this study guide to keep track of the various topics I have learned throughout the prework modules of my Front-end Development bootcamp.

Previously, keeping track of what I have learned would have been tricky, but now all material is neatly organised.

This study guide covers HTML, CSS, Git & Github, and Javascript.

## Usage

To use this study guide, refer to the topic headings listed on the homepage. Each heading covers a key area covered during prework along with some useful notes about the material learnt. 

If we open the DevTools console, we can see that Javascript lists topics that we learned, and also has a function that randomly assigns a topic to study next.
